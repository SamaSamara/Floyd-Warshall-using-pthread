input: 
dist[][] = [[0, 4, infinity, 5, infinity],
            [infinity, 0, 1,  infinity, 6],
            [2, infinity, 0, 3, infinity],
            [infinity,infinity, 1, 0, 2],
            [1, infinity, infinity, 4, 0]]

infinity means theres no direct path between the two vertices
infinity is initialized as 100000 (so its never chosen)

output:
	[[0, 4, 5, 5, 7], 
         [3, 0, 1, 4, 6], 
         [2, 6, 0, 3, 5],
         [3, 7, 1, 0, 2], 
         [1, 5, 5, 4, 0]]
